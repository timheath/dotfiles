# DO NOT USE THIS
This is a simple set of scripts for managing my dotfiles.  It's not tested
and may overwrite your configuration files!  

Feel free to take anything useful but you should look at much better examples 
from [Lars Kappert](https://github.com/webpro/dotfiles) and 
[Orr Sella](https://github.com/orrsella/dotfiles).  This repo is essentially a
fork of what [Lars](https://github.com/webpro/dotfiles) put together but with
less functionality.


## Installion
- Clone this repo to ~/dotfiles
- Run the `install.sh` script
- Run `bin/rhinstall.sh` if you're on a Redhat/CentOS 
- Log in from a new terminal to make sure you can get into your machine
- Run `bin/viminstall.sh` to get VIM goodness (all the plugins configured in the .vimrc)
